    <h1>Artificial Intelligence </h1>
    <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p>I have chosen this topic to spotlight on one of the most technological 
        trend these days known as <strong>AI</strong> (Artificial Intelligent). Therefore ; I will discuss some of the most important aspects related to Al in which it will help in a better understanding of Artificial Intelligent and both its advantages and disadvantage to be able to protect ourselves from the upcoming technological trend. This paper will also discuss some of the algorithms used in Al systems.

     <h4><u>History of Artificial Intelligence: </u></h4>
     <p>
        Artificial Intelligence was first proposed by <b>John McCarthy </b>in 1956 in his 
        first academic conference on the subject. The idea of machines operating like human beings
         began to be the center of scientist's mind and whether if it is possible to make machines have the same ability to think and learn by itself was introduced by the mathematician Alan Turing. Alan Turing was able to put his hypotheses and questions into actions by testing whether "machines can think"? After series of testing (later was called as Turing Test)it turns out that it is possible to enable machines to think and learn just like humans. Turing Test uses the pragmatic approach to be able to identify if machines can respond as humans.
